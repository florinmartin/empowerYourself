After adding node-sass (https://jira.im-c.de/browse/AI-115) it occurred the loading of "global.scss" multiple time, issue described here:

http://foundation.zurb.com/forum/posts/19189-globals-are-repeated-multiple-times
https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/issues/5863

The fix was to change in _functions.scss
line 14:

$modules: append($modules, $name);

to 

$modules: append($modules, $name) !global;
